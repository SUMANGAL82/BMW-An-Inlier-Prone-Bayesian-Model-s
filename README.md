# BMW-An-Inlier-Prone-Bayesian-Model-for-Correlated-Bivariate-Data
In various fields of experiments, particularly prevalent in the lifetime of electronic components, attempts in clinical trials, rainfall data for a specific location, and insurance claimed data produces zero or near zero observations because of faulty construction, substandard quality, non-response to treatments, scant rain in monsoon season, or reduced accident rate, etc. Usually, these observed responses are defined as instantaneous or nearly instantaneous failure observations, respectively. These observations are known as inliers in the data. Traditional parametric distributions, such as Weibull, Pareto, exponential, gamma, and log-normal, are inaccurate for modeling life data containing inliers because such failures in experiments usually discard the assumption of a uni-modal distribution. In literature, many mixture distributions have been proposed to model such scenarios. Similarly, in natural phenomena, certain bivariate correlated observations exhibit a concentration of data points around a specific point $(x_0, y_0)$, while the remaining observations adhere to a continuous distribution. In bivariate data, this scenario is characterized as responses containing inliers. In nature, there are correlated bivariate data with the presence of inliers in its components, and the region of inliers is not only restricted to the square shape. To address this, we employ copulas to derive the bivariate modified Weibull (BMW) distribution, designed to capture correlated observations in the presence of inliers. This approach involves adopting the Modified Weibull distribution as the marginal distribution, which is formulated through a mixture model combining a uniform distribution around a specific point with two parametric Weibull distributions. Moreover, we introduce a methodology for testing the presence of inliers within datasets using the supremum of Bayes factors (SBF), complemented by an extensive simulation study to assess the power of the test, results of which are depicted using a confusion matrix and observed that the accuracy of the test is more than $98\%$. Estimation of the model parameters is carried out through a Bayesian framework, selecting suitable priors for each parameter. Given the model complexities and the dimensional breadth of the parameter space, we employ Hamiltonian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, specifically utilizing the No-U-Turn sampler (NUTS) for efficient posterior sampling of parameters. To demonstrate the applicability and assess the performance of our approach, we provide numerical examples and apply the method to analyzing monsoon rainfall data from Assam, a popular tourist destination in India. In accordance with the prescribed testing methodology, our analysis indicates the presence of inliers within the rainfall dataset, as indicated by the $SBF$ value exceeding $150$. We observe that our proposed model significantly fits the rainfall data better than the base model,  as evidenced by the criteria of DIC and BIC.
